# Wattfor

This git repository contains C programs and bash scripts used to estimate the power consumption of a Fornite server by simulating the traffic load of a Fornite game.

The final report of the project can be found here (in french): https://mathcoutant.github.io/assets/wattfor.pdf

I may translate it one day.
